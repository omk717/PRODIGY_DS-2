Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic details, ticket information, and whether they survived the tragic incident. This project aims to clean the dataset and perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends that could explain the survival rates of passengers.

Data Collection
Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Ensure data quality and completeness for accurate analysis.
Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Address missing values in columns such as 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'.
Outlier Detection: Identify and manage outliers to ensure robust analysis.
Data Transformation: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats where necessary and create new features.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Demographic Insights: Analyze the age and gender distribution and their impact on survival rates.
Passenger Class: Examine the survival rates across different passenger classes.
Family Size: Investigate the effect of family size on survival chances.
Fare and Embarkation: Analyze the correlation between fare, embarkation points, and survival rates.
Visualizations: Use plots such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the relationships between variables.
Insights and Conclusion
Through data cleaning and EDA, we identified several key factors influencing the survival of Titanic passengers, including gender, passenger class, age, fare, and family size. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the event and demonstrate the importance of thorough data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
